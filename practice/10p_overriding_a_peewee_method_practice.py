# =====================================
# PRACTICE - OVERRIDING A PEEWEE METHOD
# =====================================


# 1. OVERRIDING PRACTICE

'''
Use the same dog database and class that you used in the previous practice:

The dog table should include:
    id
    name
    age
    favorite food (make it so this field is optional by adding null=True)
    
Except now, make it so that
    1. the age must be over 0 and below 25 when you create a dog

    2. the favorite food must be at least 3 characters long if it is present
       But it still should be possible to create a dog with no favorite food.
